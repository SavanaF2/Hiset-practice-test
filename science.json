      "Question 1: Behavior is the way in which organisms interact with other organisms and their environment. In both people and animals, behavior occurs in response to an external stimulus, an internal stimulus, or both. Some behaviors are innate, or built in. These innate behaviors include reflexes and instincts. Other behaviors are learned as a result of experiences. Which is an example of a reflex?",
      "Question 2: Friction is a force acting along the durfaces of objects that opposes motion. There are several types of friction. Static friction opposes the movement of a stationary object along a surface. Sliding friction is created when two surfaces slide over one another and is affected by the weight of the moving objects, the types and texture of the surfaces, and any temporary bonding between the two. Rolling friction is created when an object rolls over a surface and apposes less motion than sliding friction. Fluid friction is created when an object is moving through a fluid, ushc as a gas or liquid. \n\n A deer runs out into the road, causing the drivier to slam on his brakes. Which type of friction is demonstrated when the car skids to a stop?",

      "Question 5: Which of the following statements provides evidence that visible light is made of electromagnetic waves rather than mechanical waves?",
      "Question 6: When a person touched a mug of tea, the person's hand felt warm. Which of the following statements gives the best explanation of this observation?",
      "Question 7: Through which of the following materials does electricty travel most easily?",
      "Question 8: In which of the following substances do the molecules have the highest average kinetic energy?",
      "Question 9: An organism's genes are made up of pairs of alleles that determine, among other characteristics, its physical appearance. An allele can be dominant or recessive. In pea plants, the allele (T) for a tall plant is dominant over the allele (t) for a short plant. A particular plant is tall. What conclusion can be made about its alleles for height.",
